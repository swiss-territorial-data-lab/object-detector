# Sample Data provided by the Canton of Neuchâtel

We provide data covering a part of the Canton of Neuchâtel, split into two non-overlapping regions, which together form the Area of Interest (AoI):

1. as suggested by the filename, the `Ground_truth_sectors` dataset includes sectors for which all the relevant swimming pools visible in the 2019 orthophoto (cf.&nbsp;the `ortho2019` raster layer available through [this Web Map Service](https://sitn.ne.ch/mapproxy95/service?request=GetCapabilities)) were digitized by domain experts. Polygons related to these swimming pools can be found in the `Ground_truth_swimming_pools` dataset.

2. The `Other_sector` file provides a sector to be used for inference. The `Other_swimming_pools` file includes a collection of candidate swimming pools, which is neither exhaustive nor totally reliable.

All the datasets in this folder were originally provided by the Canton of Neuchâtel, then curated by the STDL team. __This data can be used for research purposes only. Commercial use is prohibited.__
